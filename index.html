      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>We met on New Year's Eve at a small party on the cusp of 2019. Sophia
        had been living in NYC at the time, Eli in Providence, and both ended up
        coming to New Haven for the holiday night. Somehow, inexplicably to our
        friends, we hadn&rsquo;t met each other before. Maybe it was the
        moonlight and moody December fog that evening, or the sense of
        serendipity in finding a new someone so cute and lovely among a group of
        friends we each knew well, or maybe Cupid had spiked the drinks that
        night&hellip; who knows! In any case, we kissed <em>well</em> before
        midnight struck, and from then on, it&rsquo;s been us.</p>

        <!-- getting here-->

        <h1> Getting here, staying here </h1>

   <p>Located in East Otis, Massachusetts, Camp Bonnie Brae is an overnight Girl Scout Camp overlooking Big Pond--a deceptively named lake. It&rsquo;s the oldest continuously operating Girl Scout camp, founded in 1919. Click <a href="https://media.smith.edu/departments/ssc/cbb/cbb_playlist.html" target="_blank">here</a> to see some cool archival footage of the camp!&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Camp is a...</b>
  <p>55 minute drive from Bradley International Airport in Hartford, CT
    <p>45 minute drive from Springfield, MA, Amtrak station</p>
<p>2 hour 15 min drive from Providence</p>
<p>3 hour drive from NYC
  <p>2 hour 30 min drive from Boston</p>
<p>There is parking at camp, but we do recommend sharing a ride with other guests. We made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h4BSbvPqFWaenwt_SR_qlX5sHIyHPsoLax-3VajqePs/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> that you can use to see if you can share a ride to/from the airport, train station, NYC, Providence, Boston, or wherever!</p>
<p><b>Please note that Ubers/Lyfts are not super reliable out in this area of the Berkshires.</b></p>
<br>
<h2>Come rough it with us at camp for free!</h2>

<p>We have reserved the whole of Camp Bonnie Brae for the weekend Friday 8/22 to Sunday 8/24. There are ALOT of ways to come stay with us for the whole weekend. Our ceremony and reception are going to be on Saturday 8/23, so it's also an option to travel up for the day and evening if that is easier or what's feasible for you.</p>

<p>If you do choose to stay with us at camp, you&rsquo;ll find a section in your RSVP where you can let us know any of your accessibility needs and which other guests you&rsquo;d like to be bunked with. Unless you&rsquo;re pitching a tent, we&rsquo;ll assign you a cabin, and do our best to meet everyone's needs.
<p> <em> We will assign all of our guests to suitable cabins/tents/yurts, taking into account your needs. </em>

<h2>What should I bring if I stay at camp?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Please bring a sleeping bag, blankets, sheets, and a pillow. Even in August, it can get chilly at night by the water! We recommend bringing more blankets than you&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d need, just in case. The bunks are twin XL, if you&rsquo;re bringing sheets.</li>
<li>Swimsuit and towels!</li>
<li>Snacks. Please note that all food must be stored securely in the refrigerators at camp, not loose in any tents or cabins. There are fridges around camp. There is a particularly comfortable bear around who likes to nosh on human food... </li>
<li>Bug spray and sunscreen. It can get really mosquito-y.</li>
<li>Flashlight! You&rsquo;ll need this to find your cabin at night.</li>
<li>Comfy shoes.</li>
<li>Raincoat or umbrella, just in case.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What you carry in, you must carry out! </em>We&rsquo;ll give a checklist of how to leave your cabin in good condition for when we all head out on Sunday.</p>

  <!-- faq -->
      <div id="faq">
       <h1>Questions?</h1>
        <p>Q: Is there parking at camp?
<br>A: Yes! There is a lot of parking space, but we do recommend ridesharing with other guests. Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h4BSbvPqFWaenwt_SR_qlX5sHIyHPsoLax-3VajqePs/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">see this link</a>
<p>Q: What should I wear to the ceremony and reception?
<br />A: Whatever makes you happy! We encourage color. Our wedding will take place outdoors, on dirt, so beware of sinking stilettos.
<p>Q: Can I bring a plus one?
<br>A: We would love to accommodate everyone, but due to capacity limits at camp, we won&rsquo;t be able to include additional guests. You will know if you have a plus one on your digital wedding invitation!
<p>Q: Can I bring my kids?<br />A: We&rsquo;ve included the names of all who are invited on your invitation. Please reach out if you have any questions!
<p>Q: Will there be vegan/gluten-free/other dietary options?
<BR>A: Please let us know in your RSVP of any allergies or dietary restrictions. As we are both vegetarian, the wedding will be as well, and we will try our best to accommodate any other restrictions, except for all-meat diets lol.
<p>Q: What&rsquo;s the weather like?
<br>A: The weather in Otis, MA in August is typically pretty hot and muggy, but be prepared for anything! We recommend checking the forecast closer to the wedding date and packing accordingly. Even if it is forecasted to be hot, please pack a light layer just in case.
<p>Q: Is the camp ADA-accessible?
  <br>A: We will hire a golf cart to help people who need it to get around camp. Please note there are no officially ADA-accessible bathrooms on site, but there are bathrooms that do not require going up any steps.&nbsp;
<p>Q: Who should I contact if I have any questions?
<br>A: Sophia at 203.589.6859, Eli at 781.941.6294, or Cleo at 203.676.0877</p>
